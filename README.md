UvACourses
==========

This application lets UvA registered students add/remove courses and see their grades.

It will use the basic login screen that SiS UvA offers. If the user logs in for the first time the student has to create
a 'profile' containing their current study, year and direction within the study. The reason for this, is to make the
adding of courses faster and easier when the student is shopping courses within his or her own study/direction and year.
This means that if the students whishes to add courses he will first be directed to the page that shows available courses
from that study/direction and year. However, the user can choose to shop outside his study with a link below. That link 
will lead him to a new page where it can search by study or coursenumber for a certain course.

Other than that, the user can see and follow his grades by a designated page that shows previous gained grades.

Mockup drawings of certain pages are in doc.
